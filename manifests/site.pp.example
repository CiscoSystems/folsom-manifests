# server for your OpenStack nodes

# node will serve addresses in this domain - but if it is, you can also add entries for
# the nodes in your corporate DNS environment they will be usable *if* the above addresses 
# are routeable from elsewhere in your network.

####### Preseed File Configuration #######

# 1) admin_user
# 2) password_crypted
# 3) autostart_puppet -- whether the puppet agent will auto start
# Default user is: localadmin
