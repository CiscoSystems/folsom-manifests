# This script: updates apt, and makes sure that the system is up to date with the current Ubuntu baseline
# It then downloads the current set of Cisco validated puppet modules and a set of baseline manifests from the
#  Cisco github repository
# If a proxy is necessary in order to download files from the internet, then either a proxy target can be passed
#  to the script, or the environmet variables can be pre-set before running the script locally.
